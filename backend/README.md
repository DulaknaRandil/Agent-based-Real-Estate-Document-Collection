## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language
- **FastAPI**: API framework
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: Agent framework for orchestrating workflows
- **Selenium + undetected-chromedriver**: Browser automation for navigating county websites
- **Gemini**: Primary LLM for instruction parsing and decision making
- **Neo4j**: Knowledge graph for property relationships
- **2Captcha**: CAPTCHA solving service

## LLM Implementation Details

The system implements a sophisticated LLM service with multi-model fallback capabilities to ensure high availability and performance:

### Primary LLM: Google Gemini
- **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
- **Implementation**: Using the official Google GenerativeAI Python SDK
- **Functions**:
  - Property search query parsing
  - Search strategy generation
  - Page content analysis
  - Error recovery planning
  - Deed reference extraction from HTML

### Fallback LLM #1: Groq
- **Model**: `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`
- **Activation**: Automatically used if Gemini API calls fail
- **Implementation**: Using the Groq Python client

### Fallback LLM #2: DeepSeek
- **Model**: `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`
- **Activation**: Used as last resort if both Gemini and Groq fail
- **Implementation**: Also using the Groq client with a different API key

### Intelligent Cascading Pattern
The `_call_llm_with_fallback` method implements a robust pattern that:
1. Attempts to use Gemini first
2. Falls back to Groq if Gemini fails
3. Falls back to DeepSeek if Groq fails
4. Returns predefined fallback responses if all LLMs are unavailable

### Integration with LangGraph
- Workflows are orchestrated using LangGraph for state management
- Each state transition can leverage LLM capabilities through the GeminiService
- LangSmith provides tracing and observability for complex workflows

### Performance Optimization
- Response caching for common queries
- Token optimization for cost efficiency
- Automatic retry mechanisms with appropriate backoff

## Browser Automation Implementation

The system uses Selenium with undetected-chromedriver to provide robust browser automation that can bypass anti-bot measures commonly found on county websites. Key features of our approach:

### Core Components
- **Selenium 4.11.2**: Industry-standard browser automation framework
- **undetected-chromedriver 3.5.4**: Enhanced Chrome driver that evades detection
- **Custom Browser Managers**: Specialized managers for each county website

### Anti-Bot Evasion Techniques
- **Stealth JavaScript Injection**: Custom scripts to modify browser fingerprints
- **Randomized User-Agent Strings**: Configurable through environment variables
- **WebDriver Property Masking**: Prevents sites from detecting automation
- **Plugin and Language Emulation**: Mimics real browser configurations
- **Browser Launch Customization**: Configurable Chrome options and preferences

### Advanced Browser Features
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automatic screenshots for debugging and error analysis
- **Multi-Strategy Element Location**: Fallback selector patterns for resilience
- **Explicit Waits**: Smart waiting for elements with appropriate timeouts
- **Download Management**: Configured download paths with directory organization
- **Error Recovery**: Exception handling with retry mechanisms

### County-Specific Implementations
- **CharlestonBrowserManager**: Specialized for Charleston County websites
- **BerkeleyBrowserManager**: Specialized for Berkeley County websites
- **Common Utilities**: Shared browser interaction patterns across counties

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.10+ installed
2. Neo4j (optional for knowledge graph features)
3. 2Captcha API key (for CAPTCHA solving)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY=your_api_key
   NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
   NEO4J_USER=neo4j
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=password
   ```

### Running the Server

To start the server with the standard development configuration:
```
python run_server.py
```

To prevent the server from restarting when data files change (recommended):
```
python run_server.py --no-reload
```

To use the optimized development server with better reload controls:
```
python dev_server.py
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

> **Note:** The standard configuration uses Uvicorn's auto-reload feature which watches for file changes to restart the server. This can cause the server to restart when files are added to data directories (screenshots, downloads, logs). Use the `--no-reload` option or the optimized `dev_server.py` script to prevent this behavior.

## Development and Testing
