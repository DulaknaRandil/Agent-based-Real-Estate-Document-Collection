# Agent-based Real Estate Document Collection

![Property Document Collection System](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-brightgreen)

This project demonstrates an AI agent that automates the collection of property documents from county websites, specifically targeting Charleston County and Berkeley County in South Carolina. The system uses advanced browser automation and AI techniques to navigate complex websites, extract data, and organize documents - all based on simple TMS/parcel number inputs.

- **Frontend**: User interface for entering TMS numbers and viewing collected documents
- **Backend**: AI agent powering the browser automation and document collection processes

## üìã Project Overview

The goal is to automate the tedious manual process of collecting property documents from county websites:

- **Property Cards**: Detailed property information and characteristics
- **Tax Information**: Tax bills and receipts 
- **Deed Records**: Historical ownership transfers and deed documents

The system breaks down complex human instructions into automated steps that can be executed by an AI agent, significantly reducing the time required to collect these documents.

This demo video shows the system successfully collecting documents from both Charleston and Berkeley County websites, navigating through multiple pages, handling forms, and organizing the results.

## üß† LLM Integration

This project leverages multiple LLMs (Large Language Models) with a robust fallback system to ensure reliable operation:

### Primary Model:
- **Google Gemini 2.0**: Used as the primary LLM with the `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model for all core AI functions, including:
  - Natural language query parsing
  - Website analysis and element identification
  - Search strategy generation
  - Error recovery planning
  - Deed reference extraction and optimization

### Fallback Models:
- **Groq API**: Serves as the first fallback option when Gemini is unavailable, using `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`
- **DeepSeek API**: Acts as a secondary fallback option, also using the `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b` model

### Integration Framework:
- **LangGraph**: Used for sophisticated AI workflow orchestration and state management
- **LangSmith**: Provides tracing and observability for the AI workflows

The system implements an intelligent cascading fallback pattern where if the primary LLM fails, it automatically tries the next available model, ensuring robust operation even if one LLM service is experiencing issues.
